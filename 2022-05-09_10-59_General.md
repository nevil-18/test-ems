# Notes about important topics covered during training: Javascript, ES6, React, Vue


# JavaScript
- *apply() bind() cal()* Use .bind() when you want that function to later be called with a certain context, useful in events. Use .call() or .apply() when you want to invoke the function immediately, and modify the context.
- Call/apply call the function immediately, whereas bind returns a function that, when later executed, will have the correct context set for calling the original function. This way you can 
  maintain context in async callbacks and events.

- "I Promise a Result!", "Producing code" is code that can take some time, "Consuming code" is code that must wait for the result 
- A Promise is a JavaScript object that links producing code and consuming code

# JavaScript has 3 types of scope:
- Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.
- 1.Block scope 2.Function scope 3.Global scope

# Scope of var
- Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use. var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.

- The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.

- var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.

- var variables can be re-declared and updated
This means that we can do this within the same scope and won't get an error.

    var greeter = "hey hi";
    var greeter = "say Hello instead";
and this also

    var greeter = "hey hi";
    greeter = "say Hello instead";

- Hoisting of var: Hoisting a JS mechansim where variables and function decelarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. This means that if we do this: console.log (greeter);
         var greeter = "say hello"
it is interpreted as this : var greeter;
                            console.log(greeter); // greeter is undefined
                            greeter = "say hello" 
- So var variables are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with a value of undefined.


- *Let*: is now prefered for variable decelaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is so
# Let is block scoped: A block is chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block.
- So variable decalared in a block with let is only available for use withi that block.
- Let can be updated but not re-declared: 
- Just like var, a variable declared with let can be updated within its scope. Unlike var, a let variable cannot be re-declared within its scope.
- let greeting = "say Hi";
    if (true) {
        let greeting = "say Hello instead";
        console.log(greeting); // "say Hello instead"
    }
    console.log(greeting); // "say Hi"
- Why is there no error? This is because both instances are treated as different variables since they have different scopes.

- This fact makes let a better choice than var. When using let, you don't have to bother if you have used a name for a variable before as a variable exists only within 
  its scope.

- Also, since a variable cannot be declared more than once within a scope, then the problem discussed earlier that occurs with var does not happen

- Hoisting of let: Just like var, let decalarations are hoisted to the top. Unlike var which is initialized as undefined, the let keyword is not intialized. So if you 
  try to use a let variable before decalaratio, you'll get a Reference Error.

# Const
- Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const decalarations share some similarities wiht let declarations.

- const declarations are block scoped: Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were decalred

- const cannot be updated or re-declared; This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared. So if we decalre a variable with const, we can neither do this: 
const greeting = "say Hi";
    greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Assignment to constant variable. 
nor this:

    const greeting = "say Hi";
    const greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared

- Every const declaration, therefore, must be initialized at the time of declaration.

- This behavior is somehow different when it comes to objects declared with const. While a const object cannot be updated, the properties of this objects can be updated. Therefore, if we declare a const object as this:

    const greeting = {
        message: "say Hi",
        times: 4
    }
while we cannot do this:

    greeting = {
        words: "Hello",
        number: "five"
    } // error:  Assignment to constant variable.

we can do this:
    greeting.message = "say Hello instead";
- This will update the value of greeting.message without returning errors.

*Hoisting of const*: Just like let, const decalarations are hoisted to the top but are not initialized

- So just in case you missed the differneces, here they are:
- var decalarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scopped
- var variables can be updated and re-decalred within its scope, let variables can be updated but not re-declared, const variables can neither be updated nor re-decalred
- They are all hosited to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized
- While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be intialized during declaration

# The forEach() method calls a function for each element in an array.
- The forEach() method is not executed for empty element 

# Strict Mode in React
- StrictMode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. Like Fragment, StrictMode does not render any visible UI. It activates additional checks 
  and warnings for its descendants. Note: Strict mode checks are run in development mode only; they do not impact the production build.

# Fragments in React
- React Fragments allow you to wrap or group multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM. This can be useful when rendering multiple child elements/
  components in a single parent component

# React Excercise: 
- Prnting Simple JSX
- Display array if users to browser
- Show/Hide element on Screen   
- 2 way Data Binding in React.JS  useState("data update the view")
- Disable Button: In the most of the cases, we recommend using "controlled Components" to implements forms. In a controlled componenet, form data is  handled by a React componenet. The 
  alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself.
- Child Updating Parent State. This excires demonstrate a callback function as prop, first step is to pass the callback child as prop, the child component needs a click handler calling to 
  callback once the button is clicked. For the parent component pass in the setValue setter prop to the child component. The setter will be the callback to that the child component will invoke.
- The intent of doing this Exercises is to utilize React Composition Model by passing in components as data to other components. This makes React flexible and powerful.
- React Children: On the parent component let's add children as prop. The nfind the place where we want the children to show on the parent component. Composing JSX   
  like this can avoid prop drilling and making the component dynamic and reusable.  

# Redux in React:
- Redux in React is the official React binding for Redux which allows the components in React to read data from a Redux Store, and dispatch Actions to the Store for updating the data.

- *The purpose of Redux is to help applications scale well by providing means to manage the state via a unidirectional data flow model*

# Redux
- Redux is an open-source library made using the scripting language JavaScript. Redux's primary use lies in managing and centralizing application state and it is usually used along with JavaScript libraries, for instance, React or Angular in order to build UIs (User Interfaces).
- It is a predictable state container for applications built using JavaScript. It is based on the Flux design pattern. Redux is very small in size [around2kilobytes] and has no dependencies.
- Redux includes a single Store per application. Rather than placing state information in multiple Stores across the app, Redux keeps everything in one region of the application
- In Redux, the business logic of the application resides in the Reducer

- The core principles of Redux are as follows:
- Single source of truth: The global state of our application is always put away in an object tree inside one store.
- The state is read-only: The only way to change the state of our application is by emitting an action, an object explaining what has happened.
- Changes are made with pure functions: This principle means that in order to define how the state tree is being transformed by the actions, we have to write pure reducers.

- Some of the advantages of using Redux are as follows:
- Redux provides extremely easy state transfer between the components.
- The states are always predictable in Redux and its maintenance is relatively easy.
- Debugging and testing code in Redux is simple through logging behaviour and status.
- Redux provides great performance. It might occur to us that keeping the application's state global would result in bad performance. However, usually, that is not the case as React Redux implements a lot of performance optimizations internally so that our own connected component only re-renders when it actually needs to.
- Redux also offers state persistence by storing the application's state to local storage and restoring it after a refresh.

- The typical data flow in Redux starts with a call back from the User Interface component which dispatches an action with a payload
- After that, the reducers intercept and receive the dispatched actions, generating a new application state
- After that, the actions are propagated down through a hierarchy of components from the Redux store
- Redux Saga functions as a separate thread in our programme which is solely responsible for side effects. Redux Saga is a redux middleware. In other words, it means that it can be started, paused, and aborted from the main application using standard Redux actions, has access to the entire Redux application state, and can also dispatch Redux actions.

- *“Store” in Redux is used to carry together all the states, reducers, and actions which create the app*: Some of the responsibilities of the store are as follows:
- The state of the current application from inside is held by the Redux Store.
- We can access the current state using store.getState().
- We can update the state using store.dispatch(action).
- We can also register listener callbacks using the store.subscriber(listener).

- All the Redux Store Methods are as follows:
- getState()
- subscribe(listener)
- dispatch(action)
- replaceReducer(nextReducer)

- In order to set the initial state in Redux, we have to pass the initial state as the second argument to createStore as shown below:

 const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  todos: todos,
  visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter
});

const initialState = {
  todos: [{id:100, name:'ritik', completed: true}]
};

const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  initialState
);

- *Redux Thunk*: 
- Using Redux Thunk middleware, we can write action creators returning a function instead of an action. 
- This thunk can postpone the dispatch of an action, or do conditional dispatchment
- The arguments passed to the inner function are the store methods dispatch and getState().

- The workflow features in Redux are as follows:
- Reset: The state of the store is allowed to be reset.
- Revert: Revert or Rollback to the last committed state is allowed.
- Sweep: Every disabled action which we have fired unintentionally will be removed.
- Commit: The current state is made the initial state.

- The things which we should never do inside a reducer are as follows:
- Modify the argument of the reducer
- We should assure that we do not perform any side operations such as routing transitions, API calls, etc.
- We should not call non-pure functions, for instance Date.now(), Math.random(), etc.

- *Redux Saga is a middleware library that can be useful for allowing a Redux store to interact with the resources outside of itself in an asynchronous manner, for example, making HTTP requests to external services, accessing browser storage, executing Input/Output operations and many more. These operations are also called side effects*

- React Redux: In order to use React-Redux in our application, we need to code it separately and then merge it into the main project.
- The number of features provided by React-Redux is comparatively more than React Context.

- React Context API: React Context can be used in the application directly.
- The number of features provided by React Context is comparatively less than React-Redux

- For accessing a redux store outside a react component, we can export the store from the module where it has been created with createStore as done in the following example:

store = createStore(reducer);
export default store;

- Every Redux application has multiple top-level directories as given below:

- Components: Components are used for “dumb” React components unfamiliar with Redux.
- Containers: Containers are used for “smart” React components that are connected to Redux.
- Actions: Actions are used for all the action creators, where the file name should be corresponding to the part of the app.
- Reducers: Reducers are used for all the reducers where the file name is corresponding to the state key.
- Store: Stores are used for store initialization. This directory works best in small and mid-level size apps.

- Redux Forms present in React and Redux help in enabling a form in React to use Redux for storing all of its states. They can be used with raw inputs in HTML5. Redux forms work extremely well with User Interface (UI) frameworks, for instance, Material UI, React Widgets, React Bootstrap and many more.

- The major features of Redux forms are as follows:
- Field values persistence through the Redux store.
- Validation (synchronous/asynchronous) and submission.
- Formatting, parsing and normalization of field values.


# Flux
- Flux is an application design paradigm just like the Model View Controller design pattern. Flux is nothing but a new kind of architecture that complements React and the concept of Unidirectional Data Flow. 
- Action -> Dispacter -> Store[BusinessLogic] -> View[Back->Dispacter...]
- Flux includes multiple Stores per application.
- Flux's architecture is designed to build client-side web apps

# Custom Hooks in React: 
- Is really just a function that runs inside of a component, that can run other hooks or other functions, And they can be recursive they can go forever 
- Affordances while using Custom Hooks: -> Build your own solution, -> Portable Sharable logic, -> Component Aware Abstraction, -> Rapid Iteration
- TO build custom hooks is away more portable and shareable than building custom components and trying to move around logic around with components 
- The other greate thing is that custom hooks can be compnenet aware and abstract essentially anything that we want them to. These make the m very powerful for integratng with essentially
  anything we want to integrate in the outside world away from React
- *Custom React Hooks!* It is a stateful function that uses other react built-in hooks (e.g. useState, useCallback, reducer, effect, memo ) that can wrap around the stateful logic that you wanted to gather 
  in one place and avoid copy and pasting the same logic in multiple components.
- With this approach, you can put your logic outside of the component in another function while you are getting the benefit of stateful functionalities of react.

- use cases React Hooks API:
- Portable UI Utilities, Global State, Server State, Business Logic for our applications inside of these custom hooks. 


# COMPONENTS == USER INTERFACE & HOOOKS = BUSINESS LOGIC

- window.matchMedia: it's an API that you can use to match CSS media queries in JavaScript.
